#+title: Self-hosted HTML+CSS simple website

I write the =*.org= files in [[./org-content]], and then use the script
=build.sh= to invoke a clean instance of emacs and run =build-site.el=,
which exports to [[./html-content/]] the =*.html=.

Can then be served for example with =python3= (by default on port 8000):

#+begin_src shell
  cd html-content/
  python -m http.server
#+end_src

Tested with Emacs 28.2 - Org mode 9.5.5.

*** Dependencies
- Emacs
  - =use-package=, =ox-publish=, =htmlize=
- Python 3 (for hosting)
